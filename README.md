The backend part of the _Phonebook_ application, created through exercises for Full Stack open course.

The application lives at https://matts-phonebook.fly.dev/

**Please note**

- The directory structure is slightly different from the example _Notes_ project.

- The ESlint configuration for the rules used in the example _Notes_ project is also slightly different, since I'm used to double quotes and semicolons.
